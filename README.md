</p>

An easy interface to IPFS, Libp2p and Filecoin from your Wordpress website using the Textile tools.

You can learn more about Textile from their official page: https://textile.io/

This plugin is what you need if you want to start using IPFS in a fast and easy way. 

With our plugin you can upload files from your Wordpress website to IPFS (InterPlanetary File System). All this happens thanks to the tools created by Textile.

We developed a feature called "Archive: Static Site Generator". With this feature any wordpress admin can create a static copy of their posts and upload it to IPFS in just a few clicks.

Go beyond the limits imposed by your hosting provider. Try IPFS, Textile and our plugin!

## Static sites hosted on a Textile Bucket
I uploaded my personal website to a Textile Bucket using our plugin as a Proof Of Concept. If you are a React or Angular developer, you can upload your website to a bucket and it will work as well as Amazon. I have to say that this is a very powerful plugin: https://bafzbeiahkt5dckzzsrxevmqof3e25vpv5di5rxo76p465574r7jitecei4.textile.space

## You can host dApps on Textile buckets as well
If you are a blockchain developer I'm pretty sure that you will find very useful the potential to host static websites on Textile Buckets to connect to decentralized services, like the Ethereum blockchain.  Please check this demo of a Vending Machine dApp for a POC: https://bafzbeiepgv3dzvvnvj2vgfjodgctjlypdixz6yxefkzbuonlevstjvq7cu.textile.space/

## Buckets 

Textile Buckets are a very powerful way to store your files on IPFS. With our plugin you can create, read and remove buckets and files into IPFS. Upload files directly from your panel.

You can upload entire static websites and the buckets will work correctly. If you want a great host provider you will find a great ally in Textile Tools.

Persist and share your data for posterity!

You can upload all type of files with our plugin. Images, videos, html sites, pdf files, all your files can be saved in the most advanced decentralized system ever.

Please take a look to the Textile docs for more information about the powerful Textile Buckets: https://docs.textile.io/buckets/
