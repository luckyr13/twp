# Textile Wordpress Plugin.
With this plugin you can have an interface to IPFS, Libp2p and Filecoin from your Wordpress website using the Textile tools.

You can learn more about Textile from their official page: https://textile.io/

This plugin is what you need if you want to start using IPFS in a fast and easy way. 

With our plugin you can upload files from your Wordpress website to IPFS (InterPlanetary File System). All this happens thanks to the tools created by Textile.

Still not convinced? We are working on a new feature called "Archive: Static Site Generator". With this new feature any wordpress admin can create a static copy of their posts and upload it to IPFS in just a few clicks.

Go beyond the limits imposed by your hosting provider. Try IPFS, Textile and our plugin!
